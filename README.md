# nForce2-bios-mod
Award 6.00 mod bioses for Abit NF7 and AN7 motherboards

The project aims to provide usual mods such as ROMSIP tables, NVIDIA BPL module, unhide options and fix problems existing in the stock bios, making it more user friendly and maximize the overclocking potential.
Additionally, it provides a custom ISA option rom to control several new options in bios setup screen.

As a bonus, the project provides nForce2 PCR files (for WPCREDIT) with description and possible config values for all known registers. The documentation is not public, thus everything is found via reverse-enginnering and by observing changes in PCI configuration space on a running system.
